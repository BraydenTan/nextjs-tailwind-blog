# Building Systems with the ChatGPT API

Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford's released great course called ["Building Systems with the ChatGPT API"(https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-building-system/lesson/1/introduction)，on DeepLearning.AI site.

I've followed on-screen instructions to re-create their practical Jupyter notebooks and sharing the my note and code here .

- Language Models, the Chat Format and Tokens;
- Classification;
- Moderation;
- Chain of Thoughts;
- Chaining Prompts;
- Check Outputs;
- Build an End-to-End System;
- Evaluation - Part 1;
- Evaluation - Part 2.

- ## Language Models, the Chat Format and Tokens
Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
In this course, we've provided some code that loads the OpenAI API key for you.
```python3
import os
import openai
import tiktoken
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```
