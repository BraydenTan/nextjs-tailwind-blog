## Programming in Python

Python is high level language that works on many different platforms.Python created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

** Python syntax, spaces matter **

```python
print("Hello World")
#this is ok
print("Hello World")print("Hello World")
#this will be error need move to next line like below
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")

```

```python
x = 1 + 2
print(x)
#this is correct way and will print to 3
x = 1         + 2
print(x)
#this is correct way also
x = 1         +2
+3
print(x)
#However this will be error since must keep as same line to execute otherwise need add backslash
x = 1          +2 \
+ 3
print(x)
#this will be correct
```
